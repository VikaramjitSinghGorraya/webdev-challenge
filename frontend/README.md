Hi There,

I have built this simple app which can be used to upload, store a csv file into database, and then display the required information in a pie chart or graph. The application has been built using all the lates technologies on the Frontend (React, React-Query, Chakra UI) and the backend (Node, Express, react-charts-js2, chart.js).

Use of React-Query makes it easier to make netwokr requests and hanlde the response sent by the server, plus it has various options that can help eliminate making unnecessary network requests. Chakra UI, on the other hand, allows to style the application easily and helps making it responsive for different screen sizes.

Overall, the app has a simple, easy to understand, attractive UI that helps user achieve the required task.
